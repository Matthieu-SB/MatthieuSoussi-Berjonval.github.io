									<h3 class="major">Use-case</h3>
									<p>This use-case relates to a Vendor Due Diligence dashboard I performed to assist in the fund raising process of a real-estate Group which provides property sale services in the residential house market in the UK.</p>
									<p>The aim of this Dashobard was very much to provide more details regarding the historical track records of the existing funds. I have, hence, produced quite a lot of charts and key trading metrics tables along with the relevant KPIs that are tracked in this market.</p>															
									<p>From the point of view of a Lender in the property market, this data was very useful in assessing the funds' past performance and determining their strategy for the future.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Solution</h3>
									<p>I have used the data modelling tool in Power BI to collect, transform, and connect all existing data, before layering in the necessary measures / DAX calculations to design interactive data (before doing any visuals). </p>
										The output took the form of a bespoke dynamic Power BI dashboard, securely hosted online, allowing client and bidders to interact with the analysis. Data viewable to bidders could be restricted if desired.
										The dashboard could be filtered using slicers that could be tailored as needed.
										The analysis shown was then dynamically updated based on slicer selections.
										This enabled the user to drill into the data in an engaging way. 						
									</p>
									<p>
										By building this dashboard bottom up, the client was able to drill down into the most granular elements of its data and also manage access to it.
										At the same time, by showing the business' metrics in an interactive way helped to showcase the key selling messages with the interested parties.	
									<p> An illustrative example of this is shown below.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Key takeaways</h3>
                                    <p>Reporting in Power BI for this assignement represented numerous advantages:</p>
									
									<p>&#9889;&ensp;<u><b>Easier to manage overall process</u></b></p>
									<p>The Power BI dashboard was securely hosted, allowing users to interact with the analysis, and enabling the owner (me) to manage access and/or monitor the ongoing interest in the business by measuring the amount of interaction with the dashboard.</p>

									<p>&#9889;&ensp;<u><b>Better quality</u></b></p>
                                    <p>By using <b>Power BI visuals</b>, I've been able to quickly produce high standard analysis which are often difficult to do with Excel e.g. map a customer listing or predict forecast numbers (see demo below), etc.</p>
									
                                    <p>&#9889;&ensp;<u><b>Deeper insights</b></u></p>
                                    <p>A dynamic dashboard is an effective way to unlock valuable insights hidden within the data.
									 By building dashboards bottom up, the user is able, <b>in just a few clicks</b>, to cut and dice datasets and mine the data to work out what the drivers and correlations really are.</p>
                                                                        
									<p>&#9889;&ensp;<u><b>New way to interact</u></b></p>
									<p>Need to change a chart or tweak some data in my visuals? Do I need to isolate one customer to get a clearer view of the business trend? Power BI report changes the way you interect with your client.
									 On this assignement I've discussed the key findings with my client, and I had the ability to adjust any analysis on a live basis (without altering the raw data).</p>
																		
									<h3 class="major">Output/Demo</h3>
									<p>We can slice the data in many different ways by selecting part of a visualization. Any interaction with the data will automatically update the key metrics in this Dashboard!</p>

										<source src="Videos/P1-1 Output.mp4" type="video/mp4">
									</video>
									<p>Power BI contains amazing visualization tools that will instantly elevate any analyis. In this demo, I have used the map visualization so that anyone could directly see how the location affected the deals' performance. Stacking multiple correlation charts is also a great way to reveal what are the key drivers of the profitability.  </p>
									<video class="image fit" controls autoplay loop>
										<source src="Videos/P1-2 Output.mp4" type="video/mp4">
									</video>
									<p>The forecast feature of this visualization is a powerful tool as it is always tricky to predict future numbers. This forecast tool can be set depending of the confidence %, and gives you an average, upper, and lower bound. The underlying data can then be extracted in a table, if necessary!</p>

									<p>I always find it useful to get the detailed analysis in a table so anyone could drill down into the most granular elements of the data and directly spot trends and/or explanations to unsual movements.</p>
