									<h3 class="major">Use-case</h3>
									<p>For this project, I’ve assisted my client (the management team, along with their advisers) in preparing their business for sale (Vendor Assistance project). My role included the production of a detailed financial data-book which was required to present the business on both 1) a standalone basis, and 2) a proforma basis. The reporting hadn’t always reflected the operating reality of the business the business as it has gone through multiple acquisitions and hive ups.</p>
									<p>The task was to present three years historic financial information for five trading entities shown with various level of accounts reporting (reported, audited, and adjusted), along with supporting KPIs and the ability to restate all those figures to apply multiple cost reallocations.</p>
									<p> With the powerful combination of <b><u>Alteryx</u></b> & <b><u>PowerQuery</u></b>, I’ve built an interactive Excel data-book that could be sliced and diced in any number of ways, and which pulled its data directly from the business' accounting system (a mix of <u><b>Sage</b></u> and <u><b>Access</b></u> accounting systems) - i.e. the databook could be updated with just the <b>click of a button</b> - see further details below.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Solution</h3>
									<p>I have used data analytics tools to consolidate and reconcile vast quantities of data, before layering in the necessary adjustments and reallocations. 
										The output was then produced in excel using dynamic filters so that the data could be sliced and diced in any number of ways, enabling potential buyers to identify the key drivers of the business. In situations where the business has gone through multiple acquisitions and hive ups, this tool was particularly helpful in giving bidders a clear story of what’s really happened.</p>
									<p> The data-book was fully dynamic and contained the key due diligence analysis: financial statements (profit and loss, balance sheet, cash flow), client concentration analysis, client revenue bridge, profit and Loss by customer, aged debtors, aged creditors, etc. and for which the following data layers were available:</p>
									<p> &emsp; &emsp; &#10004; &ensp; Slicer between reported (stand-alone) and proforma (i.e. as if the enlarged Group had existed throughout the Historical Period) &nbsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; numbers;
									<br> &emsp; &emsp; &#10004; &ensp; Slicer between Management, Statutory, and Normalised accounts;
									<br> &emsp; &emsp; &#10004; &ensp; Slicer by entity and sub-group of entity; and
									<br> &emsp; &emsp; &#10004; &ensp; Slicer by customer, sector, revenue stream for all the customer related analysis. </p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Key takeaways</h3>
                                    <p>The possibilities for reporting in this way are as endless as the data to hand. The key advantages spotted by the key stakeholders during the process were as follow:</p>
									
									<p>&#9889;&ensp;<u><b>Easy to view</u></b></p>
									<p>Being able to view the analysis dynamically allows the output to be on one tab of excel rather than having to present each cut individually. 
									Producing Factbook data-books can be a long-drawn-out process, only to end up with an excel data pack that is heavy, hard to read & understand.</p>

									<p>&#9889;&ensp;<u><b>Interactive and dynamic process</u></b></p>
                                    <p>The data-book could be filtered using slicers that could be tailored as needed (i.e. I  had the ability to modulate slicers based on advisors and/or bidders requirements!).
									The analysis shown was then dynamically updated based on slicer selections.
                                    This enabled the users to drill into the data <b>in an engaging way!</b></p>
									
                                    <p>&#9889;&ensp;<u><b>Deeper insights</b></u></p>
                                    <p>The analysis was tailored to show and highlight the key growth drivers in the business by cutting the data in various ways.
									Using a combination of analytics tools (Alteryx and PowerQuery), I've been able to <b>derive deeper insights</b> and then <b>present complex data into a digestible format to bidders.</b></p>
                                                                        
									<p>&#9889;&ensp;<u><b>New data</u></b></p>
									<p>Need to change date the business was reporting on? Do I need to redact my customer names or more?
									<br> Alteryx workflows and Excel data-book have been built to allow quick updates and usability; just edit the parameters or add a mapping to redact your data and let Alteryx pull the data from the source data for you. A simple click on the <b>refresh button</b> in your Excel Model will do the rest. </p>
																		
									<h3 class="major">Output/Demo</h3>
									<p>In this short demo, the profit and loss statement can by sliced in many different ways (by reporting type, perimeter, sub-group, and trading entities), meaning 90 different combinations, just to analyse trading performance. In addition, the data was made available on a monthly and yearly basis, and could be un-grouped to see more granularity in the accounts. Et Voilà, now you can easily spot any trend and/or unusual movement!</p>

									<p>The available data on this project also enabled us to cut the profit and loss by customer/cost centre, and by sector. An interactive reporting way showing where your revenue and costs growth or decline came from! </p>
									<video class="image fit" controls autoplay loop>
										<source src="Videos/P2-2_Output.mp4" type="video/mp4">
									</video>
									<p>The balance sheet supporting schedules also contained some smart analysis. The aged debtors analysis could be cut by reporting date, trading entity, or sub-group. But more interestingly you could also decide to rank your accounts receivable by balance type, i.e. by total balance, by aged (90+ days) balance, or by credit balance!</p>
